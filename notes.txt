# Adding some of my scratchpad notes while working on the project


S3 api calls generally use XML, which means keys should avoid using certain characters.  Some are invalid, others are not recommended:

Running a single `ls` command should return all the objects AND the metadata
    describing a specific object with metadata should be achievable with an `ls` command
        which means you can't lump metadata for multiple objects
        metadata can be after <objectname> and cannot contain the / character


Separating out python lib and filesystem implementation
    Pylib
        read/write blobs
        (maybe?) read/write metadata
        give a prefix and go
        probably no reserved characters
    fs
        list objects/folders
        storage redirection
        (maybe?) read/write metadata
        folders and object names have reserved characters (maybe?)
